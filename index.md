# 4 Joint Robotic Arm
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone was finishing the assembly of the robotic arm and setting up the joystick controls. Assembling the frame of the arm was my first step, and after that I began attaching the servo motors to the joints of the arm and wiring them to the Arduino. Because the servos only have a range of 180 degrees, I had to be careful attaching them at the right angle to cover all the range of motion the arm needed. I used a short program to set every servo to 0 degrees, then attached them to the arm in the positions required. The code for the joystick assigns each x and y axis of the left and right joysticks to a different servo motor. Pushing the joystick returns a value from 0 to 1024, and the script works by reading this value, and when it exceeds or is below a certain value, it will call the servos to move the arm.

# Starter Project
  
My starter project was the Simon Says game, a memory game where you copy series' of flashing lights using buttons. It's comprised of four buttons with LED lights underneath, a buzzer for sound, and a micro controller that runs the game. There are two switches, one to control the power and one to enable or disable the sound buzzer. All the parts are soldered to a board.
